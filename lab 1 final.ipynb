    "$\\textbf{Abstract:}$\n",
    "The purpose of this experiment was to observe the behavior of air at varying temperatures and the subsequent effects on volume while maintaining constant pressure. The experiment was performed utilizing a water bath and several graduated cylinders containing a set amount of air within them and observing the changes in volume as the water temperature changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Introduction:}$\n",
    "The objective of this experiment was ultimately to determine the volume of the air within the bubble present within each graduated cylinder tested. This is possible due to Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure, which allows for us to equate the pressure exerted onto the bubble with the pressure within the bubble. Dalton's Law states that the total pressure must be equivalent to the summation of all individual partial pressures in some mixture. (1) Furthermore, his work tells us that for any expansion of fluid that occurs, the expansion of air is proportionally less. (2) This means that the total pressure outside of the bubble, which in our case is the pressure of the room plus the pressure of the fluid, must equal the pressure on the inside of the bubble, which is the pressure of the air plus the vapor pressure of water. The reason that the equivalent internal pressure of the bubble is not simply the pressure of the air can be explained through first defining vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is the temperature dependent equilibrium pressure of a liquid.(3) The vapor pressure of a water plays an important factor in our experiment, as the overall temperature of the water rises, the subsequent pressure formed from water vapor will also rise, which must be accounted for in each measurement involving a change in temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical approach to obtaining the internal pressure, and subsequently the volume and moles of air, will be expanded on further in this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as the methodology of this experiment goes, the experiment was conducted by dropping three graduated cylinders with an initial pocket of air in them into a tank of water. The initial temperature, volume of air, and distance between the water level and the air bubble were all recorded. This step was followed up with alterations of the water temperature with subsequent measuring of the volume of air and distance between the water level and the bubble. After several different temperatures were taken, the results were analyzed, and the average volumes measured were used to calculate compression factors. The results showed mostly accurate values, with group 2 possessing the greatest deviations from the expected values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given that the number of gas particles N is related to the amount of moles, n via $N = nN_{A}$, we can divide 100 by avogadro's number to get n, which we can use in the ideal gas equation to specify its state. Then, to assign an energy to this state, we can use the relation, $\\frac{PV}{N} = k_{B}T$ to receive Joules.(3)\n",

    "Q6: Why can we do such “globalization” and when will it fail?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "We can do such globalization if we assume that a gas is ideal, in that no interactions and no collisions take place \n",
    "between the particles. This will fail when a gas does not behave ideally, and when certain conditions are present\n",
    "that significantly impact the behavior of a gas, such as high pressure.\n",

    "It should be noted that as the measurements were recorded, there is a high probability for slight deviations in the measured heights and distances compared with the true values due to the inherent difficulty of obtaining these measurements. With that in mind, evaluation of the systematic and random errors can take place. In this lab, to measure the distances, a measuring stick was used to yield measurements in millimeters. This instrument possesses an uncertainty of 1mm, therefore, as mentioned in reference 6 on page 8, the uncertainty of this measurement is equal to the distance +/- 0.5mm. The volumes recorded in this lab were taken utilizing a graduated cylinder accurate to 100mL. As seen in reference 7, the uncertainty for a 100mL graduated cylinder is 1mL, meaning our volumes are accurate to +/- 1mL. \n",
    "As far as comparing our measured values to the calculated values goes, we can compare the calculated volumes against the measured volumes to gather a set of std deviations to provide insight into the measurement errors present within our results. \n",

    "As can be seen through the error analysis, group 2 possessed the greatest standard deviation from the average calculated final volumes, and by association, the greatest percent error when calculating the compression factor. Group 1 had the most precise and accurate compression factor and standard deviation values. Finally, group 2 possessed overall low deviations from theoretical values, but the values were not consistently precise with each temperature. In order to improve upon this experiment to yield more accurate results, the procedure should be reformated in a manner that allows for more precise reading of the volumes and distances during the experimental portion, as there is inherent difficulty in precisely collecting these values. For future study, it would be interesting to repeat this experiment with more pronounced changes in temperature and depth to see their impacts on a larger scale."
